### Completed user stories:

* [1] Required: User can enter bill and see total plus tip auto-calculated
* [2] Required: User can select tip percentages from pre-determined amounts (#1-2 took ~90-120 minutes)
* [3] Optional: App can render adaptive layout (~ 2 hours)
* [4] Optional: User can enter an "other" amount for tip percentage (~90 minutes)

User stories #1-2 were instructed by the codepath-provided tutorial: https://vimeo.com/102084767.
